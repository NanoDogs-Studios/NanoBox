Breaking Changes:
- ClientApiSystem is now named SteamworksBehaviour
An obsolete ClientApiSystem class is included to help guid code conversion if required. It is recomended to use SteamSettings as opposed to SteamworksBhaviour or ClietnApiSystem as these mono behaviours are simply wrappers around the SteamSettings' funcitonality

Note:
This build uses a modified version of Steamworks.NET v15 based on Steamworks SDK v1.51
The modification corrects for a known issue involving the GameServer.Intit method and bindings on on the m_usSteam port change introduced in SDK v1.51

Patch Notes:
- Applied changes to the SteamSettingsEditor script as a responce to a bug where changes in editor dont always save to disk
- Exposed the MatchmakingTools object to SteamSettings.Client.matchmaking
- Streamlined initalization to remove funcitonality from the main behaviour
- Renamed the "Client API System" behaviour to "Steamworks Behaviour"
- Corrected a bug where the steam initalization event wasn't always triggering as expected
- improved support for Mirror Server intializaiton process
- Added toggle for "auto logon" which will optionally automatically log the Steam Game Server API on once Steam has initalized. If you have the "Enable Mirror" option toggled as well this will happen after the Mirror Start Server has become active
- Corrected addtional event names to conform to the Heathen and Unity naming standards

====================
PLEASE NOTE
====================

Steamworks.NET comes preinstalled with this package in the folder ./_HeathenEngineering/Steamworks/Plugins/
If you already have Steamworks.NET installed you may need to resolve conflicts.
Of key importance is the assembly def "Setamworks.NET.asmdef" that we have added to ./_HeathenEngineering/Steamworks/Plugins/Steamworks.NET/
This assembly def is referneced by our own asembly defs located in each module of the Framework. If this is not present and does not include Steamworks.NET's objects you will have issues. 

To resolve the common issue of 
CSteamId is not found are you missing an assembly reference

Please locate the Steamworks.NET.asmdef that we have included  which should be located at ./_HeathenEngineering/Steamworks/Plugins/Steamworks.NET/Steamworks.NET.asmdef and move it to where ever you have Steamworks.NET plugin installed
such that it is housed within the Steamworks.NET folder that the plugin includes.

If you have issues where in Steam attempts to launch your game (or Spacewar) when you start simulating in Unity the most likely cause of this issue is that you do not have steam_appid.txt located in the root of your project.
steam_appid.txt is a simple text file that should be located in the root of your project (beside not in the Asset folder) it should contain only your app ID.

An example of a valid steam_appid.txt follows, only the content between the dashed lines should be used e.g. only the number 480 should be in the file.
               
               Start File
-----------------------------------------------
480
-----------------------------------------------
               End File
